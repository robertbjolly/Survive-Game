# Survive-Game
Pygame project April, 2020

Survive
Survive is my first ever coding project, where I used the Python library called Pygame. At the start of the project I was firmiliar with the basics of Python and wanted put the skills I learned to the test. The objective of this project was to create a videogame similar to the classic Zelda, that a user would play for a minimum of ten minutes. As my first ever programming project ever, I am very happy with how the game turned out.

Project Difficulties
This was my first ever programming project, so it was the first taste of creating a large project over months and months. The biggest challenge was learning the tricks and problem solving challenges to achieve what I desired in the game. I began to realize how coding takes creativity to solve certain problems.

How I Overcame Difficulties
I was able to take away many problem solving techniques while developing this game. It taught me a lot, especially when it comes to Object-Oriented Programming.
